# Ontology context for agents

Generated from the water-ontology schema (version 0.1.0); do not edit. Tables are in catalog `water_core`; the table for a class is shown in brackets. Abstract classes have no table; query the union views `topology.asset` and `model.swmm_element`, or `reference.entity` (every entity with its class).

## Identity and conventions

- Every row has `iri` (the thing) and `class_iri` (what it is). Use IRIs, never labels, as tool arguments; resolve names through `label` and `alt_ids`.
- Connectivity, drainage, containment, attachment, zone membership and model links are rows in `topology.edge` (`from_iri`, `relation`, `to_iri`), never columns on an asset.
- An asset is linked to its SWMM model element by a `REPRESENTED_BY` edge; `topology.*` values are SI (m, ha, mm, m3/s), `model.*` values keep the model's own units.
- Tables with `valid_to` are versioned; read the `<table>_current` view unless the question is historical.
- Every derived value carries `was_generated_by`; cite it (attempt, model version, job) with any number you report.
- Units are QUDT IRIs in a `unit` column or a column tag; never assume a unit.

## Rules the data must satisfy

The validator enforces these; open violations are in `reference.ontology_violation`. If an entity you reason about appears there, say so.

- Both ends of every edge are known entities.
- Every in-service Link has exactly one upstream node (Node CONNECTS_TO Link) and one downstream node (Link CONNECTS_TO Node).
- Every Subcatchment has at least one DRAINS_TO edge.
- Every Subcatchment has at least one USES_GAGE edge.
- Every Sensor has at least one ATTACHED_TO edge.
- Every Asset has at least one PART_OF_SYSTEM edge.
- An asset is REPRESENTED_BY at most one model element per revision.
- An asset with model links is REPRESENTED_BY an element in some system's current revision.
- A WaterSystem's current_revision is a known Revision.
- A work order that resolves an event is COMPLETED with a completion time.
- A work order proposed by an AI agent is not APPROVED or beyond without a human approver.
- A RESOLVED event has a RESOLVED_BY link.
- CONFIRMED, IN_PROGRESS and RESOLVED events record who confirmed them.
- An AI agent may detect an event but never confirm it.
- Every event is LOCATED_AT or AFFECTS something.
- occurred_at <= detected_at <= ended_at where present.
- A prediction's target entity is an instance of its model's applies_to_class.
- A model has at most one CHAMPION version.
- An observation's unit is its property's default unit (after normalisation).
- Each relation only connects the classes listed under Relations.

## What an agent may and may not do

- May read governed tables and call registered tools; may write `AgentFinding` rows, events in state DETECTED with source AGENT, and proposals (`Setpoint`, `WorkOrder`) that name a human approver field left empty.
- May not confirm events, approve work orders, set setpoints, or issue control actions.
- Must state staleness, non-GOOD quality flags, out-of-scope predictions and non-current model revisions when they affect an answer.
